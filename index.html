    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      YearCal is a website that can be used as an offline app on a mobile device to display your Google Calendars.
      It is located here
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://yearcal.netlify.app/" target="_blank">
          <b>Year Cal website (yearcal.netlify.app) </b>
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>

      YearCal was designed to display just over one year of events in a single page that can be scrolled up and down. In a sense each time you look at it is like having a new physical diary on the 1st January where there are 53 weeks available in the future to look at and plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today is always on the top of the screen, <b> this app is not designed to look back in time. </b> 
    </p>
    <p>
      In these examples the grey events are deemed important enough to show in the day box but not when looking at the whole year. So this is why there are no grey items in the thin rectangles. Birthdays and other anniversaries are in a red google calendar. These you want to see when planning so for example the <b> Valentine </b> item is both shown in the boxes and the thin coloured rectangles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike any other electronic calendar, you are able to scroll from today to this day next year, seeing <b> all </b> the events inbetween in a fraction of a second, and furthermore they remain visible the whole time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some of the design decisions made which make this a useful tool for home users in particular where you want to see not just upcoming events, but visually the length of time (in days) before they will arrive. For business users with multiple meetings in a single day it is not really suitable since displaying a year of events at that scale would not be helpful. One key thing to note is that empty days are displayed so that they contribute visually to showing distance in time. You can have as many events as you wish in a day and the day box will enlarge to show them all, however just like all days once scrolled they are a little rectangle just like any other day but with a marker showing if there is an event.
    </p>
    <p>
      For adding, editing and deleting events a link to Google Calendars is provided. Year Cal is a year planner but it is important to have a convenient link to change events.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Show all events in a day without elipses</li>
      <li>The same display is used from mobile to desktop with a cunning splitting of the week into weekdays and weekend for small devices</li>
      <li>The 5/2 split enables a readable month view on small phones while seeing events in their place - a unique feature of YearCal</li>
      <li>Choose whether to show events from a calendar or not, OR to only show them in the day box but not the mini rectangle</li>
    </ul>
